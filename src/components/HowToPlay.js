        <h3>1. Enter Weekly Battles</h3>
        <p>
          Each week, new battles open with unique monologue prompts. Browse the
          available battles, select the one that excites you, and get ready to
          showcase your talent.

        <h3>2. Vote to Enter (If Required)</h3>
        <p>
          You have 5 votes for each battle. Use them wisely! When submitting
          your entry - if a battle has more than 5 existing entries, you must
          vote on one performance before you can submit yours. This ensures fair
          play and keeps the community engaged. Remember: once you vote for an
          actor, that vote is final and you can't unvote.

        <h3>3. Record Your Self-Tape</h3>
        <p>
          Film your monologue in your own time, on your own setup. The quicker
          you submit, the more chance you have of getting votes.

        <h3>4. Track Your Progress</h3>
        <p>
          Vote counts for all entries remain hidden until the battle ends,
          ensuring voting decisions remain purely based on talent and not
          numbers. You can always see the vote count on your own entry to track
          how you're performing.
